     <h4> Q : What is TraderInsight?</h4>
     <p>TraderInsight allows you to perform effective, in-depth investment research with a range of research packages we offer. TraderInsight will highlight a company’s strengths and weaknesses at a glance. Our Packages filter and screen different stock and trade ideas so you can make an effective decision.</p>
     <h4> Q : Are there any hidden costs?</h4>
     <p>No. Your monthly, or annual, subscription fee is all you will pay. Prices include VAT.</p>
     <h4> Q : Are you financial advisors or provide share tips?</h4>
     <p>No, our aim is to teach customers how to make their own investment decisions. The investment management industry makes a vast amount of money playing on investor ignorance. We believe that if you understand why you are buying an investment and the factors that can affect the value of that investment you will be better positioned to manage your savings safely. Ultimately, you will be a more successful investor.</p>
     <h4> Q : How do trade signals work?</h4>
     <p>Depending on the package you subscribe to you will receive research ideas based around specific stocks/FX /Commodities/Bonds or Funds which will include potential entry levels along with risk management levels. Trade Signals should purely be viewed as research and not advice.</p>

     <h4> Q : Which package is right for me?</h4>
     <p>It will depend on your level of knowledge of the financial markets along with your financial goals. We have an array of packages to cater to all your investment needs.</p>
     <h4> Q : Am I locked in a 12-month contract?</h4>
     <p>No, you are never tied in for more than one month. Even with our cheaper annual subscriptions, you can cancel with a month's notice and we will refund the unused part of your subscription. Note that if you cancel an annual subscription we will charge the full monthly rate for the months used and deduct this from your annual subscription in order to calculate your refund.</p>
