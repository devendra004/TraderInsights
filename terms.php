              <h3>No Investment Advice</h3>
              <p class="padb_20">Our Website is a financial data and news portal, discussion forum and content aggregator. TraderInsight is not a broker/dealer, we are not an investment advisor, we have no access to non-public information about publicly traded companies, and this is not a place for the giving or receiving of financial advice, advice concerning investment decisions or tax or legal advice. We are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority</p>
              <p class="padb_20">We are an educational forum for analysing, learning & discussing general and generic information related to stocks, investments and strategies. No content on the site constitutes - or should be understood as constituting - a recommendation to enter in any securities transactions or to engage in any of the investment strategies presented in our site content. We do not provide personalised recommendations or views as to whether a stock or investment approach is suited to the financial needs of a specific individual.</p>
              
              <h3>Individual Empowerment, not Hand-Holding</h3>
              <p class="padb_20">This is the beginning of a journey, not the end. Where we present investment screens, the results should only be treated as candidates for further research, not as a buy list or set of recommendations. Screening may help to narrow a search based on pre-defined criteria but it is not a substitute for independent research reflecting your individual criteria for investing/trading.</p>
              <p class="padb_20">Where we offer valuation tools, these are solely for informational & educational purposes so that users can easily run their own valuations. The pre-defined values are simply a starting point based on global assumptions that we have applied across the entire market – users should amend them as they see fit and not regard them as a substitute for their own judgment. Any resulting valuation outputs are necessarily generic and are not endorsed for a given stock by TraderInsight.</p>
              <h3>User Generated Content</h3>

                  The value of shares and investments and the income derived from them can go down as well as up;</li>

              <p class="padb_20">
                (a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);
              </p>
              <p class="padb_20">(b) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us and maintaining your user profile (which may include your email address, name, location, personal details and/or images of you that you upload);</p>

              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p class="padb_20">A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
              <p class="padb_20">We may use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. The session cookies enable our website to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. The persistent cookies will enable our website to recognise your computer when you visit our website.</p>
              <p class="padb_20">Whilst session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser, persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
              <p class="padb_20">Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including ours.</p>
              <p class="padb_20">In addition, we use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies.

             <h3>International data transfers</h3>
             <p class="padb_20">Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
             <p class="padb_20">If you are in the European Economic Area, information which you provide may be transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area</p>
             <p class="padb_20">In addition, any personal information that you publish on the website will be available via the internet around the world.
               
             </p>
             <p class="padb_20">You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.</p>

             <h3>Site Improvement Cookies</h3>
             <p>We regularly test new designs or site features on our site.

These so called 'analytics programs also tell us if how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.</p>
             <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>
             <p class="padb_20">Cookies are widely used in online advertising. Neither us, advertisers or our advertising partners can gain personally identifiable information from these cookies. We only work with advertising partners who work to accepted privacy standards such as <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/iab-good-practice-principles" </a></p>
             <p class="padb_20">You can learn more about online advertising at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com"></a> . You can opt-out of almost all advertising cookies at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices although we would prefer that you didn't as ultimately adverts help keep much of the internet free. It is also worth noting that opting out of advertising cookies will not mean you won't see adverts, just simply that they won't be tailored to you any longer.

            Banner Adverts
            </h3>
            <p class="padb_20">We fund our site by showing adverts as you browse our site. These adverts are usually managed by a partner specialising in providing adverts for multiple sites. Invariably these partners place cookies to collect anonymous data about the websites you visits so they can personalise the adverts to you, ensure that you don't see the same adverts too frequently and ultimately report to advertisers on which adverts are working. Our partners include:</p>
            <h3>Affiliate Cookies</h3>
            <p class="padb_20">We have a number of partners who promote our service on a success-only basis (i.e. instead of paying for advertising, we pay them commissions on sales). Cookies are required to allow us to reward these partners and these cookies are usually provided by specialist companies (known as affiliate networks). Neither us, the networks, or the partner advertising or recommending our services are able to identify you personally. We ask you to support us by allowing these cookies which ultimately help us to offer you the service we do at the price we do. Our affiliate cookies are provided by:</p>
            <h2>Turning Cookies Off</h2>
            <p>You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of our's and a large proportion of the world's websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites</p>
            <p>It may be that you concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware". Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive. </p>
